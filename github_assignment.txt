I cloned a file from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s page called "One St. Louis." I mostly chose it because I was curious to know what "One St. Louis" meant but also because several other repositories denied me permission. The description on github says One St. Louis is an interactive project that allows readers to click and drag counties on a map to create a new layout of St. Louis. Once they do that, the new population and demographic totals for each county appear. Poking around the repository, I can sort of understand each of the files. In the CSS file, I can see some code for “before” and “after,” which I’m assuming refers to the physical map before and after someone interacts with it, but I’m not really sure what the code actually says. I can also see a lot of code for the physical appearance of the project — code for things like buttons, dimensions, column headers, font family, popup explainers and more. In the data file, there’s demographic/statistical information on each county in delimited text files. The image file just holds jpgs of images used to promote the project on social media. The final folder, js, is the one I can’t figure out. It’s got a bunch of random js and clipboard files in it, but I can’t understand what they say or how they relate to the project.
