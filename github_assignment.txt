I cloned a file from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s page called "One St. Louis." I mostly chose it because I was curious to know what that meant. However, I also selected it because I’d tried to clone several other repositories before this one and all denied me permission. “One St. Louis” worked, so I went with it. The repository description on github says “One St. Louis” is an interactive project that allows readers to click and drag counties on a map to create a new layout of St. Louis. Once they do that, the new population and demographic totals appear. Poking around on terminal, it's hard to get a feel for what is in each folder and how all the parts fit together. Most of the folders hold .js, .txt and other similar files, so I can't actually find out what's in them. There are only four folders I can actually get into — css, data, img and js — and each of those mostly hold files that I can’t access, such as .json, .png and other files. The names of the files aren’t super revealing, either. I can understand the names in the image file — logos, social media share buttons, etc. — but the rest are titled general names like “main,” or “municipalities,” so it’s hard to know what role those files play in the actual interactive map. I'd like to see the final project to better understand the files and folders in the repository.
